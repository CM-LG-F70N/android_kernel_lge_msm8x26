|From: Marek Vasut <marex@denx.de>
|Date: Fri, 3 Aug 2012 20:54:48 +0200
|Subject: [PATCH 0224/1799] ARM: mxs: Remove MMAP_MIN_ADDR setting from
| mxs_defconfig
|
|commit 3bed491c8d28329e34f8a31e3fe64d03f3a350f1 upstream.
|
|The CONFIG_DEFAULT_MMAP_MIN_ADDR was set to 65536 in mxs_defconfig,
|this caused severe breakage of userland applications since the upper
|limit for ARM is 32768. By default CONFIG_DEFAULT_MMAP_MIN_ADDR is
|set to 4096 and can also be changed via /proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr
|if needed.
|
|Quoting Russell King [1]:
|
|"4096 is also fine for ARM too. There's not much point in having
|defconfigs change it - that would just be pure noise in the config
|files."
|
|the CONFIG_DEFAULT_MMAP_MIN_ADDR can be removed from the defconfig
|altogether.
|
|This problem was introduced by commit cde7c41 (ARM: configs: add
|defconfig for mach-mxs).

|
|commit 770f750bc2b8312489c8e45306f551d08a319d3c upstream.
|
|cmd was freed in pn533_dep_link_up regardless of
|pn533_send_cmd_frame_async return code. Cmd is passed as argument to
|pn533_in_dep_link_up_complete callback and should be freed there.

|
|commit 70418e6efcf4f8652cc08e3f2ab8ae35f0948fd9 upstream.
|
|cmd is allocated in pn533_dep_link_up and passed as an arg to
|pn533_send_cmd_frame_async together with a complete cb.
|
|arg is passed to the cb and must be kfreed there.
